# AI Usage Report: ADmyBRAND Insights Dashboard

This report outlines the collaborative workflow between the developer and an AI assistant in the creation of the "ADmyBRAND Insights" dashboard, a full-stack project built with Next.js and shadcn/ui. The AI's role was that of a real-time pair-programmer, providing architectural guidance, code generation, and advanced troubleshooting from start to finish.

The project began with the AI generating a comprehensive plan, recommending a modern tech stack (Next.js, shadcn/ui, Recharts), and providing the initial setup commands. This foundational guidance ensured best practices were followed from the start.

The core of the development followed a component-driven methodology. For each feature—from metric cards to the data table—the AI provided complete, isolated code snippets. This modular approach allowed for rapid development and easy integration.

Crucially, the AI served as an on-demand troubleshooter. When persistent "Module not found" or TypeScript errors occurred during the Vercel deployment, the AI systematically guided the debugging process, identifying issues with type definitions, file paths, and component scope. This interactive debugging was far more efficient than searching through online forums.

Finally, when implementing advanced features, the AI provided both the logic and code for complex tasks like simulating real-time updates with `useEffect`, adding a date range picker, and implementing CSV export functionality. It also guided the final deliverables, providing templates for the `README.md` file and step-by-step instructions for deploying the application to Vercel. The partnership proved highly effective, transforming a complex project brief into a fully functional and deployed application efficiently.
